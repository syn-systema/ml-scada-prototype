@main.py#L1-580 i changed the training time to 10 minutes. One question I have is how can we specifiy the right models? For example arseer@ai-stratagens:~/ai-scada$ docker compose exec tsdb psql -U scada -d scada_timeseries -c "SELECT * FROM sensor_data ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"

does one model fit all these?

I'm glad you updated the training time to 10 minutes in the automl-service code. This will give H2O AutoML more time to explore and build better models. Now, let's address your question about specifying the right models and whether one model fits all the different sensor types shown in your TimescaleDB query output.

Does One Model Fit All These Sensors?
In the current implementation of the automl-service in main.py, a single model is trained to predict values for all sensors. Here's how it works based on the code:

Data Aggregation: The function fetch_training_data() retrieves data for all sensors listed in SENSORS_TO_PREDICT (which includes pressure-1, flow-1, temp-1, etc., as shown in your query output) from TimescaleDB. It fetches up to 10,000 records across all these sensors combined.
Data Processing: In process_data(), the data is processed by extracting time-based features (year, month, day, etc.) and one-hot encoding the sensor_id. This encoding creates binary columns for each sensor (e.g., sensor_id_pressure-1, sensor_id_flow-1), allowing the model to differentiate between sensor types within the same dataset.
Model Training: In run_automl_training(), H2O AutoML trains a single model (or rather, selects the best from a set of models) on this unified dataset. The model learns to predict the value column (the sensor reading) using all other features, including the one-hot encoded sensor IDs and historical data features (like previous values and rates of change).
Prediction: During prediction in prediction_loop(), data for each sensor is processed similarly, and the same trained model generates predictions for all sensors, with results published to individual MQTT topics based on sensor_id.
Implications:

Pros: Using one model simplifies the system architecture. It reduces complexity in training, deployment, and maintenance since you don't need to manage separate models for each sensor. H2O AutoML can potentially learn shared patterns across sensors (e.g., temporal trends that apply to multiple sensor types).
Cons: A single model might not be optimal for all sensor types if they have very different behaviors or scales. For instance, pressure-1 values (ranging around 23-35 in your data) and oil-production (around 75) have different magnitudes and possibly different predictive patterns. A single model may struggle to capture these nuances as effectively as specialized models per sensor or sensor group.
How Can We Specify the Right Models?
To address whether one model fits all and to improve prediction accuracy, you have several options for specifying or training the "right" models. Here are the approaches you can take, along with how to implement them in your system:

Stick with One Model but Improve It:
When to Use: If the current model's performance is acceptable across all sensors (you can check this via H2O Flow UI metrics like RMSE or MAE per prediction), or if simplicity is a priority.
How: Increase training time (as you've done to 10 minutes) or adjust max_models in run_automl_training() to allow H2O AutoML to explore more algorithms. You can also add more features in process_data() (e.g., more lagged values or custom transformations) to help the model differentiate sensor behaviors.
Implementation: No major code changes needed beyond what you've already done.
Train Separate Models per Sensor or Sensor Group:
When to Use: If you notice poor performance for certain sensors with the single model, or if sensors naturally group into categories (e.g., all pressure sensors vs. temperature sensors) with similar behaviors.
How: Modify the automl-service to train and store separate models for each sensor or group. In H2O Flow UI, you can manually train models on filtered datasets (e.g., only pressure-* sensors) and save them with distinct IDs. Then, use the H2O_MODEL_ID mechanism to load different models for different prediction tasks.
Implementation: Update fetch_training_data() to fetch data per sensor or group, train models in a loop in main(), and store them in a dictionary keyed by sensor ID or group. During prediction, select the appropriate model based on sensor_id. I can implement this if desired.
Use H2O Flow UI to Experiment and Select Models:
When to Use: If you want your non-ML engineer coworkers to experiment with different models and choose the best ones without coding.
How: As implemented, users can access H2O Flow at http://localhost:54321, filter data for specific sensors or groups, train models with AutoML, evaluate them, and save the best model IDs. Then, set H2O_MODEL_ID to use a specific model system-wide, or modify the code to load multiple models based on a configuration mapping model IDs to sensors.
Implementation: Current setup supports this for a single model. For multiple models, we'd need a configuration file or environment variables mapping sensors to model IDs. I can add this functionality if you'd like.
Dynamic Model Selection Based on Performance:
When to Use: If you want the system to automatically pick the best model for each sensor over time.
How: Implement a feedback loop in automl-service to periodically retrain models, evaluate performance against recent data, and select or switch to the best model per sensor. H2O allows model performance tracking, which can be logged and used for decision-making.
Implementation: Add logic in prediction_loop() to compare predictions with actuals (fetching recent data), score model accuracy, and trigger retraining or model switching if performance drops below a threshold. This requires significant code changes, which I can help with.
Recommendation for Your Case
Given the data from your TimescaleDB query showing different sensor types (pressure, flow, temp, vibration, oil-production, etc.) with varying value ranges, I suspect that training separate models or models per sensor group might yield better accuracy. However, since you're focused on a rapidly deployable prototype and enabling non-ML engineers, here's my suggested path forward:

Start with the Current Single Model: Monitor its performance via H2O Flow UI or by comparing predictions to actuals in FUXA HMI. You've already increased training time to 10 minutes, which should help.
Use H2O Flow UI for Experimentation: Encourage coworkers to use the UI to train models on subsets of data (e.g., only pressure sensors) and save promising models. They can note the model ID of high-performing models for specific sensors or groups.
Implement Multi-Model Support if Needed: If the single model underperforms for certain sensors, I can update the automl-service to handle multiple models based on a configuration (e.g., a JSON or environment variables mapping sensors to model IDs).
Answering Your Question Directly
Does one model fit all these? Currently, yes, the system uses one model for all sensors by distinguishing them via one-hot encoded features. However, this might not be optimal for accuracy across diverse sensor types.
How to specify the right models? You can use H2O_MODEL_ID to load a specific model trained in H2O Flow UI for all predictions, or we can extend the system to support multiple models per sensor or group. For now, experiment in H2O Flow to identify the best model(s), and let me know if you want to automate multi-model handling.
Would you like me to update the automl-service to support separate models per sensor or group, or do you prefer to first evaluate the current single model's performance? I can also help rebuild and restart the service to apply your recent changes (prediction interval to 30 seconds and training time to 10 minutes). Let me know!
